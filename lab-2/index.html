    <h3>SCENE I. Rome. Before a gate of the city.</h3>
    <p><strong>Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS, and others.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>CORIOLANUS:</strong> Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast<br>
    With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,<br>
    Where is your ancient courage? you were used<br>
    To say extremity was the trier of spirits;<br>
    That common chances common men could bear;<br>
    That when the sea was calm all boats alike<br>
    Show'd mastership in floating: fortune's blows,<br>
    When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves<br>
    A noble cunning: you were used to load me<br>
    With precepts that would make invincible<br>
    The heart that conn'd them.</p>

    <p><strong>VOLUMNIA:</strong> O heavens! O heavens!</p>

    <p><strong>CORIOLANUS:</strong> Nay, I prithee, woman—</p>

    <p><strong>VOLUMNIA:</strong> Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,<br>
    And occupations perish!</p>

    <p><strong>CORIOLANUS:</strong> What, what, what!<br>
    I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother,<br>
    Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,<br>
    If you had been the wife of Hercules,<br>
    Six of his labours you'd have done, and saved<br>
    Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,<br>
    Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:<br>
    I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,<br>
    Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,<br>
    And venomous to thine eyes. My (sometime) general,<br>
    I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld<br>
    Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women<br>
    'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,<br>
    As 'tis to laugh at them. My mother, you wot well<br>
    My hazards still have been your solace: and<br>
    Believe't not lightly—though I go alone<br>
    Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen<br>
    Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen—your son<br>
    Will or exceed the common or be caught<br>
    With cautelous baits and practice.</p>

    <p><strong>VIRGILIA:</strong> My first son,<br>
    Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius<br>
    With thee awhile: determine on some course,<br>
    More than a wild exposture to each chance<br>
    That starts i' the way before thee.</p>

    <p><strong>CORIOLANUS:</strong> O the gods!</p>

    <p><strong>COMINIUS:</strong> I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee<br>
    Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us<br>
    And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth<br>
    A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send<br>
    O'er the vast world to seek a single man,<br>
    And lose advantage, which doth ever cool<br>
    I' the absence of the needer.</p>

    <p><strong>CORIOLANUS:</strong> Fare ye well:<br>
    Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full<br>
    Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one<br>
    That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.<br>
    Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and<br>
    My friends of noble touch; when I am forth,<br>
    Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.<br>
    While I remain above the ground, you shall<br>
    Hear from me still, and never of me aught<br>
    But what is like me formerly.</p>

    <p><strong>MENENIUS:</strong> That's worthily<br>
    As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.<br>
    If I could shake off but one seven years<br>
    From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,<br>
    I'd with thee every foot.</p>

    <p><em>They embrace and part. Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others.</em></p>

    <p><strong>VOLUMNIA:</strong> Give me thy hand: come.<br>
    Thou hast been said to have done no deed of death;<br>
    But thou wilt do more. Pray be content:<br>
    Mother, I am going to the gods; they can protect me.</p>

    <p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

    <h2>Addendum</h2>
    <p>
        In this HTML version of *Coriolanus, Act IV, Scene I*, I structured the text semantically to reflect both its literary and theatrical nature. 
        The entire play text is wrapped in an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element to represent a self-contained work. 
        Each major section, such as the scene heading, uses an <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> to preserve hierarchy under the main title and author in <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Character names are emphasized using <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> tags to distinguish speakers visually and structurally. 
        Stage directions are italicized with <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> to maintain their traditional appearance and to differentiate them from dialogue.
    </p>

    <p>
        Paragraphs (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) are used to separate each speech or stage direction, ensuring clarity and readability. 
    </p>

    <p>
        A semantic <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> introduces the document, giving context with the title and author. 
        Finally, the required <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> includes the JavaScript snippet for showing the page’s last modified date, which ensures compliance with lab submission requirements.
