        <h3>Scene I. Rome. Before a gate of the city.</h3>
        <p><strong>Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS, and others.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>CORIOLANUS:</strong> Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast<br>
        With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,<br>
        Where is your ancient courage? you were used<br>
        To say extremity was the trier of spirits;<br>
        That common chances common men could bear;<br>
        That when the sea was calm all boats alike<br>
        Show'd mastership in floating: fortune's blows,<br>
        When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves<br>
        A noble cunning: you were used to load me<br>
        With precepts that would make invincible<br>
        The heart that conn'd them.</p>

        <p><strong>VOLUMNIA:</strong> O heavens! O heavens!</p>

        <p><strong>CORIOLANUS:</strong> Nay, I prithee, woman—</p>

        <p><strong>VOLUMNIA:</strong> Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,<br>
        And occupations perish!</p>

        <p><strong>CORIOLANUS:</strong> What, what, what!<br>
        I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother,<br>
        Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,<br>
        If you had been the wife of Hercules,<br>
        Six of his labours you'd have done, and saved<br>
        Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,<br>
        Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:<br>
        I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,<br>
        Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,<br>
        And venomous to thine eyes. My (sometime) general,<br>
        I have seen thee stern, and thou hast oft beheld<br>
        Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women<br>
        'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,<br>
        As 'tis to laugh at them. My mother, you wot well<br>
        My hazards still have been your solace: and<br>
        Believe't not lightly—though I go alone<br>
        Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen<br>
        Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen—your son<br>
        Will or exceed the common or be caught<br>
        With cautelous baits and practice.</p>

        <p><strong>VIRGILIA:</strong> My first son,<br>
        Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius<br>
        With thee awhile: determine on some course,<br>
        More than a wild exposture to each chance<br>
        That starts i' the way before thee.</p>

        <p><strong>CORIOLANUS:</strong> O the gods!</p>

        <p><strong>COMINIUS:</strong> I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee<br>
        Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us<br>
        And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth<br>
        A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send<br>
        O'er the vast world to seek a single man,<br>
        And lose advantage, which doth ever cool<br>
        I' the absence of the needer.</p>

        <p><strong>CORIOLANUS:</strong> Fare ye well:<br>
        Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full<br>
        Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one<br>
        That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.<br>
        Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and<br>
        My friends of noble touch; when I am forth,<br>
        Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.<br>
        While I remain above the ground, you shall<br>
        Hear from me still, and never of me aught<br>
        But what is like me formerly.</p>

        <p><strong>MENENIUS:</strong> That's worthily<br>
        As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.<br>
        If I could shake off but one seven years<br>
        From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,<br>
        I'd with thee every foot.</p>

        <p><em>They embrace and part. Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others.</em></p>

        <p><strong>VOLUMNIA:</strong> Give me thy hand: come.<br>
        Thou hast been said to have done no deed of death;<br>
        But thou wilt do more. Pray be content:<br>
        Mother, I am going to the gods; they can protect me.</p>

        <p><em>Exeunt</em></p>

        <h2>Stylistic Choices Addendum</h2>

        <h3>Font Choices</h3>
        <p>
            I selected <strong>"Playfair Display"</strong> for headings to evoke a classical, literary aesthetic, 
            suitable for Shakespeare’s tone. For the main text, I chose <strong>"Lora"</strong>, 
            a serif font optimized for readability in long paragraphs.
        </p>

        <h3>Text and Heading Sizes</h3>
        <p>
            The title (<code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>) is large and centered for prominence. 
            Subheadings (<code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>) use smaller, proportional sizes. 
            The main text is set to 18 px for easy reading on standard laptop screens.
        </p>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <p>
            I used a soft parchment background (<code>#fdfaf5</code>) to suggest aged paper. 
            Text is a dark brownish-gray (<code>#2b2b2b</code>) for contrast. 
            Accents (e.g., headings and links) use <code>#5a3e36</code>, a warm tone reminiscent of ink on paper.
        </p>

        <h3>Spacing and Layout</h3>
        <p>
            Paragraphs are separated by clear margins, and line spacing is slightly increased (1.8 ×) 
            for comfort. The page content is centered with a maximum width of 900 px for balance. 
            Quotes and stage directions are indented for visual distinction.
        </p>

        <h3>HTML Abuse Corrections</h3>
        <p>
            In my Lab 2 version, I used <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> for the essay title. 
            I’ve corrected that to <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> because the title is the top-level heading.  
            I also removed any inline italics used for appearance and replaced them with semantic tags like 
            <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> for structure and meaning.
