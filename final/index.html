        <h2>Project Addendum</h2>
        <p>
            For this project, I implemented a 5×5 version of the Lights Out puzzle. The HTML structure is kept minimal,
            while the board itself is generated entirely through JavaScript to ensure flexibility. Each tile on the board
            responds to user clicks by toggling itself and its four neighbors in accordance with the original puzzle rules.
        </p>

        <p>
            To ensure that the board is always solvable, I began from an all-lit grid and applied a random series of
            simulated tile presses. Since this mimics actual gameplay logic, any resulting configuration is reachable
            through valid moves, making every starting position solvable. This was one of the most important logic
            decisions in the project.
        </p>

        <p>
            For visual flair, the title uses the colorful "Righteous" font, while the rest of the page uses "Space Mono,"
            creating an intentional contrast to satisfy the project’s font requirement. A glowing box effect was added to
            tiles to make the on/off states visually distinct.
        </p>

        <p>
            A small challenge I faced was preventing the win message from triggering during shuffle. I solved this by giving
            my toggle function a flag that disables win checking during automatic moves. This separation of "player move"
            vs. "setup move" prevented false victory alerts.
